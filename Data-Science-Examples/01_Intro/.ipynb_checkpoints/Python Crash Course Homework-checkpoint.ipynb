    "### Homework Guidelines\n",
    "The homework assignments will be available right after each lecture (except this one, sorry...). They will prepare you for the exam and for real-world working with data. Doing your homework is _completely optional_. However, you are **strongly encouraged** to do it in order to expand your knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will (try to) review the assignments you send through the SoftUni system and provide general and personal feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have one week for each homework assignment. After that, the submission form will be closed. If you, however, think that you've done a great work and want to show it to me but you've missed the deadline, just write an email to yordan@softuni.bg and I'll have a look.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The homework assignments are not a part of your final grade for this course. Feel free to do as much or as little as you wish at home. I will suggest that you spend as much time as possible but that's entirely up to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submitting Your Homework\n",
    "For each homework assignment create a Jupyter Notebook or import the one I'll have given to you. Save that notebook in an appropriately named folder (for example, this one might be **Python-Crash-Course**). Inside that folder, add any other resources (such as datasets) that you need to work with. Zip the folder and submit it in the course page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The SoftUni server has an upper limit on files. If your file is bigger than 4 MB, the system will reject it. You'll have one of two options:\n",
    "1. Upload the file elsewhere (e.g. OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive) and instead of the .zip file, upload a .txt file with the link to the external upload.\n",
    "2. Remove some files. If, for example, you're using a very large dataset, just provide a link to it inside a README.txt file and I'll be able to download it and run your notebook with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's up to you to decide what approach you're going to take."

    "### Problem 1. Playing with Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "As you already saw, Jupyter Notebook is a very light, beautiful and convenient way to organize your research and display your results. Let's play with it for a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you can double-click each cell and edit its content. If you want to run a cell (that is, execute the code inside it), use Cell > Run Cells in the top menu or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, each cell has a type. There are two main types: Markdown (which is for any kind of free text, explanations, formulas, results... you get the idea), and code (which is, well... for code :D).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me give you a...\n",
    "#### Quick Introduction to Markdown\n",
    "##### Text and Paragraphs\n",
    "There are several things that you can do. As you already saw, you can write paragraph text just by typing it. In order to create a new paragraph, just leave a blank line. See how this works below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is some text.\n",
    "This text is on a new line, but it will continue the same paragraph (so you can make your paragraphs more easily readable by just continuing on a new line, or just go on and on like this one line is ever continuing).\n",
    "\n",
    "This text is displayed in a new paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is yet another paragraph.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Result:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is some text.\n",
    "This text is on a new line, but it will continue the same paragraph (so you can make your paragraphs more easily readable by just continuing on a new line, or just go on and on like this one line is ever continuing).\n",

    "\n",
    "And this is yet another paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Headings\n",
    "There are six levels of headings. Level one is the highest (largest and most important), and level 6 is the smallest. You can create headings of several types by prefixing the header line with one to six \"#\" symbols (this is called a pound sign if you are ancient, or a sharp sign if you're a musician... or a hashtag if you're too young :D). Have a look:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Heading 1\n",
    "## Heading 2\n",
    "### Heading 3\n",
    "#### Heading 4\n",

    "### Heading 3\n",
    "#### Heading 4\n",
    "##### Heading 5\n",
    "###### Heading 6\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you have **only one** H1 heading - this should be the header of your notebook (or scientific paper). Below that, you can add your name or just jump to the explanations directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Emphasis\n",
    "You can create emphasized (stonger) text by using a **bold** or _italic_ font. You can do this in several ways (using asterisks (\\*) or underscores (\\_)). In order to \"escape\" a symbol, prefix it with a backslash (\\). You can also strike thorugh your text in order to signify a correction.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**bold** __bold__\n",
    "*italic* _italic_\n",
    "\n",
    "This is \\*\\*not \\*\\* bold.\n",

    "This is \\*\\*not\\*\\* bold.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ~~didn't make~~ a mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Lists\n",
    "You can add two types of lists: ordered and unordered. Lists can also be nested inside one another. To do this, press <kbd>Tab</kbd> once (it will be converted to 4 spaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an ordered list, just type the numbers. Don't worry if your numbers are wrong - Jupyter Notebook will create them properly for you. Well, it's better to have them properly numbered anyway...\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. This is\n",
    "2. A list\n",
    "10. With many\n",
    "9. Items\n",
    "    1. Some of which\n",

    "```\n",
    "* This is\n",
    "* An\n",

    "* An\n",
    "    + Unordered\n",
    "        - list\n",
    "        \n",
    "##### Links\n",
    "There are many ways to create links but we mostly use one of them: we present links with some explanatory text. See how it works:\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is [a link](http://google.com) to Google.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is [a link](http://google.com) to Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Images\n",
    "They are very similar to links. Just prefix the image with an exclamation mark. The alt(ernative) text will be displayed if the image is not available. Have a look (hover over the image to see the title text):\n",
    "```\n",
    "![Alt text](http://i.imgur.com/dkY1gph.jpg \"Do you know that \"taco cat\" is a palindrome? Thanks to The Oatmeal :)\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "If you want to resize images or do some more advanced stuff, just use HTML. \n",
    "\n",
    "Did I mention these cells support HTML, CSS and JavaScript? Now I did.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tables\n",
    "These are a pain because they need to be formatted (somewhat) properly. Here's a good [table generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables). Just select File > Paste table data... and provide a tab-separated list of values. It will generate a good-looking ASCII-art table for you.\n",

So, thanks to Donald Knuth (a very popular computer scientist, who also invented a lot of algorithms), we have a nice typesetting system, called LaTeX (pronounced _lah_-tek).
